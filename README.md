### :rocket: Engineer
My adventure in tech started early and brought me to the Eindhoven University of Technology, where I've been diving deep into the world of software development and machine learning. From crafting chatbots at Signify to pioneering applications at EU Flex, I've embraced the challenge of turning ideas into reality. With every line of code, I strive to push the envelope further, leveraging tools like:
- **Kubernetes** for orchestrating containers to perfection,
- **Python** as my wand for crafting magic in automation and data manipulation,
- **React** for when I venture into the enchanting lands of front-end development.

### 📊 Data Scientist in Training
On the quest for knowledge, I'm currently mastering the art of machine learning at TU/e, exploring the potential of TensorFlow and PyTorch. Whether it's enhancing code quality for ING or unveiling the origins of carpets through CNN, my journey is a testament to the power of data in unlocking new insights.

### 👨‍🔬 Researcher
There's something thrilling about unraveling the mysteries of AI. My focus? Diving into deep learning to automate and innovate, from recognizing intricate patterns to refining the interaction between humans and machines. It's a path of constant discovery, and I'm here for every step.

### 🗣 Communicator
I'm on a mission to demystify the complex world of tech. Though my journey into blogging and speaking is just beginning, my goal is to spark conversations that matter, sharing the wonders of AI and machine learning with a wider audience.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community Contributor
Building bridges in the tech community is what I aim for. Whether contributing to open-source projects or engaging in meaningful tech discussions, I believe in the collective power of collaboration to drive innovation.

### 👨‍🏫 Educator at Heart
There's a unique joy in sharing knowledge, and as I navigate through my career, I'm eager to mentor the next wave of tech enthusiasts, guiding them through the complexities of machine learning and beyond.
