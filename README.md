# Hi there, Pleased to meet you👋

If you've landed here, maybe you've seen my projects, we've met through my educational journey at TU/e, or you're intrigued by what a Machine Learning Engineer and Full Stack Developer is up to these days. Welcome aboard!

## `whoami`
### 🚀 Engineer
Diving into computer science during my time at Eindhoven University of Technology kindled a passion that has driven me to explore everything from natural language processing at Signify to full-stack development at EU Flex for KNSF. My toolkit is ever-expanding, but here are a few favorites:
- **Python & SQL** for everything data.
- **Kubernetes** for keeping my projects running smoothly.
- **TensorFlow & PyTorch** for when I'm deep into machine learning.

### 📊 Data Scientist in Training
Currently wrapping up my MSc in Data Science and AI, I'm on a mission to unlock the stories hidden within data. Whether it's enhancing code quality at ING with automated testing tools or deciphering carpet patterns with CNN, I'm all about finding innovative solutions.

### 👨‍🔬 Researcher
At the heart of it, I'm a problem-solver. My research spans the practical to the profound in AI, seeking out new ways to leverage technology for real-world applications. I'm always ready to dive into the next challenge, especially if it involves dirty datasets or the quest for explainable AI.

### 🗣 Communicator
Though my main stage has been my projects and classes, I'm stepping into the world of blogs and talks to share my journey and learnings. I'm passionate about making the complex accessible and engaging in the broader conversation on tech's future.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community Contributor
Building and being part of communities is where I thrive. My experiences range from contributing to open-source projects to fostering tech discussions. I'm all in on collaborations that push boundaries and make a difference.

### 👨‍🏫 Educator
Teaching and sharing knowledge is a joy. From workshops to formal courses, I'm dedicated to empowering others with the skills to explore the fascinating world of tech.

Thanks for stopping by! If you're interested in collaborating or just want to chat about tech, AI, or anything in between, I'm all ears. Let's make something amazing together.
