## `Whoami`
### 🚀 Engineer

My journey in computer science began in middle school, sparking a passion that led me to the Eindhoven University of Technology. I've since navigated the realms of Full Stack and Machine Learning Engineering, taking ideas from conception to deployment. My toolkit includes:
- **Python** for its versatility in back-end and data science applications.
- **React** for when front-end challenges arise, though I'm humbly navigating its depths.
- **TensorFlow & PyTorch** for pushing the boundaries of machine learning and AI.

### 📊 Data Scientist in Training

As I delve deeper into my MSc in Data Science and AI, I'm committed to using data for meaningful insights, showcased through projects like automated testing tools for ING and carpet pattern recognition.

### 👨‍🔬 Researcher

AI fascinates me, especially its potential to unravel complex patterns and automate tasks. My work reflects a dedication to exploring the limits of current technology and beyond.

### 🗣 Communicator

Sharing knowledge and engaging with the tech community energizes me. I'm keen on contributing more through blogs and talks, diving into discussions about technology's evolving landscape.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community Contributor

I'm at the beginning of my journey in contributing to open-source projects and being an active community member, focusing on initiatives with societal benefits.

### 👨‍🏫 Educator at Heart

I believe in the transformative power of education. Sharing my insights and learning with others, especially those just embarking on their tech journey, is something I look forward to.

I'm excited about collaborations, particularly those making a societal impact. Feel free to reach out!
