If you've stumbled upon my GitHub, it's likely because you've seen my work, we've connected through my network, or you're curious about what I do. Welcome!

Whoami

🚀 Engineer
My journey into the world of computer science began at the Eindhoven University of Technology, where my passion for software development and machine learning took root. As a Full Stack Engineer and Machine Learning Engineer Intern, I've tackled projects from natural language chatbots at Signify to developing comprehensive applications for EU Flex for KNSF. I thrive in environments that challenge me to stretch my capabilities, whether optimizing backend systems or leading the deployment of innovative solutions.

📊 Data Scientist in Training
Currently pursuing my MSc in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, I am deepening my expertise in machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. My project work, including automated testing tools and carpet pattern recognition using CNN, underscores my commitment to leveraging data for insightful outcomes.

👨‍🔬 Researcher
I'm fascinated by the potential of AI to solve complex problems. My research interests lie in the realm of deep learning and its applications in understanding patterns and automating tasks. The projects I've worked on reflect a dedication to pushing the boundaries of what's possible with current technology.

🗣 Communicator
I believe in sharing knowledge and learning from the collective wisdom of the tech community. While I'm on the path to contributing more actively through blogs or talks, I'm eager to engage in discussions about technology's impact and future.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community Contributor
Though early in my career, I aim to contribute to open-source projects and be an active member of the tech community. I'm particularly interested in projects that have a positive societal impact.

👨‍🏫 Educator at Heart
Education is a powerful tool for empowerment. As I navigate my career, I look forward to opportunities to teach and mentor, sharing my journey and insights with those just starting out.

Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a bit better. I'm always open to collaboration, especially on projects aimed at making a difference. Don't hesitate to reach out!
